Projects using selenium


For any of these projects you need to do the following

You need to install a webdriver. The webdrivers used in these projects are the Chrome webdriver and occasionally PhantomJS

The links are here

[Chrome Web driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

[PhantomJS](https://phantomjs.org/download.html)


After downloading these webdrivers and unzipping them if needed, you need to add the file location to your path variable in environment variables. After all of this, you need to use the pip command to download selenium

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install selenium.

```bash
pip install selenium
```
